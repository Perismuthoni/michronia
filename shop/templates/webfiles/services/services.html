      <h2>BOOK KEEPING SERVICES</h2>
      <p>Bookkeeping is the process of recording financial transactions on a day-to-day 
          basis by a business. It helps to ensure that the records of every individual financial 
          transaction are up-to-date and accurate. Individuals or entities that carry out the 
          bookkeeping process are known as bookkeepers. The bookkeepers are responsible for classifying, 
          recording and organising every financial transaction made
           in the course of the business operations. </p>

      <h2>FORENSIC ACCOUNTANCY</h2>
      <p>Forensic accounting utilizes accounting, auditing, and investigative 
          skills to conduct an examination into the finances of an individual or business.

        cases to explain the nature of a financial crime in court</p>
